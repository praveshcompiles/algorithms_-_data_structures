## This repository contains Python code for Algorithms and Data Structures that I learned so far. 


**Note: I learn and practice from GeeksforGeeks.org, so most of my codes are very similar or even exactly same
compared to the articles/authors in GeeksforGeeks.
I have taken the effort to understand the algorithms and wrote all the code and logic on my own.
